Online Submission Form

Web forms appear everywhere online: forms allow users to order books, sign up for websites, and post to Facebook. This project challenged me to build a responsive, mobile-first registration form using a variety of HTML form elements. 

My favorite part of this project was adding custom CSS styles. Simple additons like hover color on buttons, or highlighting the current input field make the page more interactive. I'm excited to learn a backend language to make my forms in the future fully functional.
